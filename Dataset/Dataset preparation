A dataset of RNA–protein complexes was created by extracting all 3D structures containing at least one water molecule and having resolution better than 2.5 Å available at the Protein Data Bank (PDB) before March 15, 2022. To remove redundancy, complexes with over 30% sequence identity were filtered out using the CDHIT suite (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3516142/), resulting in a final nonredundant dataset of 329 crystal structures.

These 329 crystal structures were analyzed using HBPLUS (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8182748/) to identify hydrogen bonds within RNA–protein complexes, resulting in the generation of ‘.hb2’ files.
